<h1>What is Asala Perahara?</h1>
	<p>
		The month of July which is also called “ Esala ”, is 	considered as a month of celebrations and festivity among most of Sri Lankans. It is also considered as the beginning of the rainy season for Sri Lankan up country. Since the 6th BC, Esala festival had been held to celebrate Buddha's special life events namely, the conception, renunciation and the first sermon. Dalada perahara is the biggest event in the celebration of Esala. Most of the ancient and specific features of Dalada perahara can be seen today, with the addition of some features with the available resources. In the 18th century, when king Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe was ruling the country, Dalada pemahare was combined with four other devala peraharas to create a series of perehare. This glorious event was celebrated since the antient times !!

		<strong>Kumbal  Perahara</strong> is the first perahara of the series of the Dalada perahara. It parades five days ( for this year 16th,17th, 18th, 19th and 20th of August ) in the street of Kandy. It is shown to the infants to drive away Evil spells and ill will. As only drummers and tuskers walk and Nilames do not walk in this perehare it is known as a semi procession. Those drummers and tuskers do 	not wear their ceremonial costumes during these five days.

		<strong>Randoli perahara</strong> parades for five days (this year 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th of August) in the Kandy streets. In the ancient times the queen was paraded in the randoli perahara in palanquins and then as it was considered that the participation of a queen was not adequate to the procession of the Sacred Tooth Relic.Thereafter, that item had been removed but palanquin is carried in the procession even today as an honor for the queen. It is the last item of the procession.
